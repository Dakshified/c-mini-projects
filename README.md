# My C++ Programs

This repository contains my daily C++ programs to maintain my GitHub streak.  
Each program is small, simple, and meaningful.

## Programs
- **program1.cpp** → KM ↔ Miles Converter  
- **calculator.cpp** → Simple Calculator (supports +, -, *, /, %, ^)  
- **tic_tac_toe.cpp** → Tic Tac Toe (2-player console game)  
- **number_guessing.cpp** → Number Guessing Game (random number between 1–100)

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
